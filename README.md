## Features
- It _copies_ an initial name tag you designed _as many as the number of participants_.
  - You can copy and paste an array of names from any spreadsheet software.
- It places the right number of name tags into _A4 size_ artboards (usually 2-3) to work with any printer.
  - Choosing other paper size options is not available yet. (ie. Letter)
- It generates _vertical lines_ in subtle grey along the edges of name tags for you to cut easily.
